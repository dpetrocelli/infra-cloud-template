"""Trains a tiny classifier at BUILD TIME (inside the Docker image), not at
runtime. This is the pattern discussed in class 7 (IA): weights live outside
the app code, baked into the image (or, in a fancier setup, pulled from
object storage on startup). Here we keep it simple: the model file ends up
next to the server code inside the image.
